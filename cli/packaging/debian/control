Description: Single Packet Authorization server and client
 openme is a lightweight SPA (Single Packet Authorization) tool.
 openme serve listens on a UDP port and temporarily opens a firewall
 rule when it receives a valid cryptographically-signed knock packet
 from an authorised client.  Only clients holding a valid Ed25519 key
 can knock — to a port scanner the service port is always closed.
 .
 This package includes both the server (openme serve) and the client
 (openme connect / openme add) in a single binary.
