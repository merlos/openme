title: "Configuration Reference"
---

openme uses YAML configuration files for both the server and the client.
All key material is stored inline in base64 (WireGuard-style), so there is
only one file to back up per host.

- [Server Config](server.qmd) — `/etc/openme/config.yaml`
- [Client Config](client.qmd) — `~/.openme/config.yaml`
- [Firewall Backends](firewall.qmd) — `iptables` vs `nft`

## File Permissions

Both config files are written with **`0600`** permissions because they contain
private key material. The directories (`/etc/openme/`, `~/.openme/`) are
created with `0750` and `0700` respectively.

Never commit config files to version control.
