This guide gets you from zero to a working openme setup in about five minutes.
You'll end up with:

- A server daemon running on Linux, listening for knock packets
- A client config on your local machine
- A successful knock that temporarily opens SSH

**Prerequisites:**

- Linux server with `iptables` or `nftables`
- Go 1.21+ (to build from source) or a pre-built binary
- `sudo` / root access on the server

## Steps

1. [Install openme](server-setup.qmd#install) on both server and client
2. [Set up the server](server-setup.qmd) — `openme init` + `openme serve`
3. [Add a client](adding-clients.qmd) — `openme add alice`
4. [Configure the client](client-setup.qmd) — paste the generated config
5. [Connect](client-setup.qmd#connect) — `openme connect`

Proceed to [Server Setup →](server-setup.qmd)
