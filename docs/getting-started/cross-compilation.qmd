title: "Cross-Compilation"
---

The openme CLI is pure Go with no CGo dependencies, making cross-compilation
trivial — no extra toolchains or Docker required.

## Build for All Platforms

From the `cli/` directory:

```bash
# Linux amd64 (server)
GOOS=linux   GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/openme-linux-amd64   ./cmd/openme

# Linux arm64 (Raspberry Pi, cloud ARM, AWS Graviton)
GOOS=linux   GOARCH=arm64 go build -o dist/openme-linux-arm64   ./cmd/openme

# macOS Intel
GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/openme-darwin-amd64  ./cmd/openme

# macOS Apple Silicon
GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=arm64 go build -o dist/openme-darwin-arm64  ./cmd/openme

# Windows
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/openme-windows-amd64.exe ./cmd/openme
```

## Makefile

A convenience `Makefile` is provided in `cli/`:

```bash
make build-all    # builds all targets into dist/
make test         # runs tests with race detector
make release      # builds + checksums for GitHub Releases
```

## CI

The GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/cli.yml` builds all targets
on every push and uploads the binaries as artifacts. See that file for the
exact build matrix.

## Notes

- `CGO_ENABLED=0` is set by default to ensure fully static binaries
- Windows builds do not support `iptables`/`nft` (firewall calls are no-ops); the Windows client is send-only
- macOS client can send knocks but cannot act as a server (no firewall integration)
