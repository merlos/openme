## Config File

The client config lives at `~/.openme/config.yaml` (created with `0600`
permissions — it contains your private key).

Paste the block printed by `openme add` on the server, or write it manually:

```yaml
profiles:
  default:                                  # used by `openme connect`
    server_host: "myserver.example.com"
    server_udp_port: 7777
    server_pubkey: "base64..."              # server's Curve25519 public key
    private_key:   "base64..."             # your Ed25519 private key
    public_key:    "base64..."             # your Ed25519 public key
    post_knock:    "ssh user@myserver.example.com"  # optional

  home:                                     # used by `openme connect home`
    server_host: "home.example.com"
    server_udp_port: 7777
    server_pubkey: "base64..."
    private_key:   "base64..."
    public_key:    "base64..."
```

The profile named `default` is used when no profile name is given. You can
have as many named profiles as you like — one per server.

## Connect {#connect}

```bash
# Health check — confirm server is reachable before knocking
openme status

# Knock using the default profile
openme connect

# Knock using a named profile
openme connect home

# Open the firewall to a specific IP instead of your source IP
openme connect --ip 10.0.0.5

# Open the firewall to a specific IPv6 address
openme connect --ip 2001:db8::42
```

If `post_knock` is set in the profile, it is run automatically after a
successful knock — useful to make `openme connect` feel like a transparent
wrapper around `ssh`.

---

## Status Check

```bash
openme status           # checks default profile's health port
openme status home      # checks the 'home' profile
```

A successful health check means the server's TCP port is accepting connections.
It does not guarantee that a knock will succeed (key might be revoked, clock
might be skewed), but it's a useful first diagnostic.

## Scripting

```bash
# Knock then connect — inline without post_knock in config
openme connect home && ssh user@home.example.com

# Use a specific config file
openme --client-config /etc/myapp/openme.yaml connect
```
