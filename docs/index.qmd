Welcome to the openme documentation. openme lets an authenticated client send
a **single encrypted UDP packet** to temporarily open a firewall port. To any
port scanner, the port is always closed — only valid clients can trigger a rule.

## Where to Start

### 🚀 New to openme?
Start with the [Getting Started guide](getting-started/index.qmd) — you'll
have a server running and a client connecting in under five minutes.

### 🔐 Curious about the security?
Read the [Protocol specification](protocol/index.qmd) for a full breakdown of
the cryptographic design, or the [Security Model](security/index.qmd) for the
threat model.

### ⚙️ Configuring your deployment?
The [Configuration reference](configuration/index.qmd) covers every option
for both server and client config files.

### 📖 Looking for the API?
The [API Reference](api/index.qmd) is auto-generated from Go source comments

## At a Glance

```bash
# Server — one-time setup
sudo openme init --server myserver.example.com
sudo openme add alice                           # prints client config
sudo openme serve

# Client
openme status                                   # health check
openme connect                                  # knock + optional post-hook
openme connect home                             # named profile
```

## Design Principles

openme is deliberately minimal in its attack surface:

- **One binary** — server daemon, client, and key management in one tool
- **No PKI** — keys are exchanged out-of-band (copy/paste or QR scan)
- **No open ports** — the knock port appears closed at all times
- **Modern cryptography** — Curve25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, Ed25519
- **Forward secrecy** — ephemeral ECDH per knock; old captures cannot be decrypted later
